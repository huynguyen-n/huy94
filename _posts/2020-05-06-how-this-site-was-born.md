ðŸŽ‰ It's been an incredible journey of self-discovery and growth as an iOS Engineer, and I'm excited to showcase my work and achievements in one central hub. Today, I want to share the story of how this site came to life-a digital testament to my journey. It's a tale of passion, dedication, and countless hours of creativity.

Create a portfolio website has been a game-changer for me, allowing me to present my skill, experience, and projects to potential employers and clients in a visually appealing and organized manner. This website also is a place for me to note and store the awesome things about my works and discover about the technology.  I yearned for a digital canvas to express my love for iOS development and demonstrate the impact of my work.

I've started my career with hybrid mobile application, I used AngularJS and Cordova at that time. So, that is a foundation for me to build this site with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This combination allowed me to create a seamless and interactive user interface, ensuring a delightful browsing experience for visitors.

What you can found from this site? The heart and soul of this site lie in the projects I've poured my dedication into.  I carefully curated a portfolio that showcases the range and depth of my skills as an iOS Engineer. Each project represents a milestone, a testament to my growth and unwavering commitment to excellence. From the About Me page to the descriptions of my projects, iOS issues, Swift knowledge, I aimed to engage visitors, enabling them to understand my story and the value I bring.

Today, May 6th, holds a special place in my heart. It marks the beginning of two significant events in my life: the start of a cherished relationship with my girlfriend and the signing of an important contract that profoundly impacted my life. It is with great significance that I chose to launch this site on this memorable day. This site is a reflection of my passion for iOS development and my unwavering commitment to personal growth and professional excellence.

Thank you for joining me on this incredible adventure. Feel free to explore every corner of this site, immerse yourself in the projects, and connect with me. Let's embark on new adventures together, fueled by innovation, creativity, and the boundless possibilities of iOS development.

Welcome to my world.

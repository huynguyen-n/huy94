He's a coder... to learn the pronunciation of his name, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzC0T0bJpTU&ab_channel=PronounceNames). Also, his years old are reflected on the domain. He is excited to start this blog as a platform to express himself and share updates about his programming journey ðŸŽ’

He learned about front-end web development in school, but his career started in mobile development with Cordova and AngularJS. While working at that company, he took it upon himself to learn iOS development to maintain an outdated application using Objective-C and Swift. This opened up a whole new universe of possibilities for him. ðŸš€
